        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Infectious Disease Prediction System is an advanced analytics platform that combines 
          epidemiological data with cutting-edge machine learning techniques to predict disease 
          outbreaks with improved accuracy and extended lead time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By integrating environmental factors, demographic data, and mobility patterns, 
          our system can provide early warnings 3-8 weeks before potential outbreaks, 
          giving public health officials valuable time to implement preventive measures.

            <h3>Data Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Our system integrates multiple data sources including epidemiological data, 
              environmental factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall), demographic information, 
              and mobility patterns to create a comprehensive feature set for our prediction models.

            <h3>Support Vector Machines</h3>
            <p>
              We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to identify potential outbreak 
              conditions based on multiple variables. This approach provides high accuracy in 
              distinguishing between normal disease patterns and outbreak scenarios.

            <h3>Self-Organizing Maps</h3>
            <p>
              Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) provide intuitive visualization of complex disease patterns 
              and relationships between environmental and demographic factors. This helps in understanding 
              the clustering of outbreak events and their common characteristics.

            <h3>LSTM Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>
              Long Short-Term Memory networks analyze temporal patterns in disease data, capturing 
              complex relationships between time-lagged variables. This enables accurate forecasting 
              of disease cases with a 3-8 week lead time, critical for early intervention.

        <h2>Model Performance</h2>
        <p>
          Our integrated approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional outbreak 
          prediction systems:
        </p>
        <ul className="performance-list">
          <li>3-8 week lead time for outbreak predictions, compared to 1-2 weeks in conventional systems</li>
          <li>Improved prediction accuracy through multi-modal data fusion and feature importance analysis</li>
          <li>Better interpretability through visualization techniques and explainable AI components</li>
          <li>Reduced false positive rates compared to single-model approaches</li>
          <li>Actionable recommendations based on risk assessment</li>
        </ul>
